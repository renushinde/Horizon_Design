# Horizon Design
### Horizon Design was my first project developed from scratch without relying on any frameworks or any blog/youtube.
### For this project, I received the Figma design from client and I needed to deliver the website within 10 days.
### I had a great time learning and coding this project, at the same time it was challenging as it was first time working with Figma.
